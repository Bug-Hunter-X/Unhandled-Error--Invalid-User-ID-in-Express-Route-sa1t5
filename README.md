This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
